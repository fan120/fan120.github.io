						<h5><font size="5" face="Rockwell">Unspoken Influence</font></h5>
							<p><font face="Georgia">Looking back, you think you don’t really make much of an impact on people. But then you start thinking. Reading back to old messages and thoughts you had. Conversations with other people and then conversations they have with others. And then it hits you. The bad things you say about someone to their friend moves into their thoughts and then they are thinking those bad things about the person you were talking about. When you first started saying those things, you were frustrated with the events going and you just wanted to say what was on your mind. Now you realize that everything you said made a huge impact to the person you were talking to, the person you were talking about, and how they feel about that person.</p>
							<p>Initially, you were just sharing your thoughts, but your thoughts stuck in their mind and now the attitude you had towards the person you were talking about, they now have that attitude towards that person.</p>
							<p>You never realized how much of an influence you actually made. When you talk, ask, or tell someone to do something — they do it. Little to no questions asked. Why is that? Why do people let you do whatever you want? You can get away with so much that other people would not be able to. It can’t be from helping them. It can’t be from the fact that they like or appreciate you, it has to be something else. Something you do causes people to have this unknown trust on you, doesn’t matter what you do — it’s not considered a bad thing or it is considered to be okay. So why do they put so much trust on you. You share absolutely nothing to very little, you are rude and somewhat inconsiderate, and you would much rather stop a conversation than continue because you were bored.</p>
							<p>And yet they continuing letting you do whatever you please, whenever you please, not even giving a second thought as to the fact it could be a bad thing. Is there that much trust in the world now? I don’t believe it. Everything I look outside, I see people who are alone, angry, and wanting to run from something that never ends. Why do you get all the benefits that no one else has?</p>
							<p>You have so much influence over others and you haven't even realized it. There is some much you could do with just the right people, guiding them in the right direction. So go out find the people  you can work with, and help them succeed.</p></font>

						<h5><font size="5" face="Rockwell">The Surroundings</font></h5>
							<p><font face="Georgia">If I stood up in front of all the people I know and asked them what I wanted to do with my life and where I want to go. I can guarantee no one would know.</p>
							<p>It's not that I don't  tell them or haven't said anything, it's more about the fact that they haven't asked. People nowadays are so focused on themselves that other people are just a extra to them. Nothing too special, just there will you need something or someone to talk to. I'm not saying everyone is like that but the environment I am in right now, many people are. They are so focused on their life, future, and where they are going they don't stop and take the time to appreciate anyone else's life.</p>
							<p>Then there are the ones who keep saying they are going to do something but they never actually do anything about it. It's all just talk. They want to do something, but they don't have the discipline or motivation to  actually move on with their idea. That's why the environment you live in is so important. Surround yourself with people who are motivated, looking to succeed, and make an positive impact on your life. Many times we are surround by people who don't care about our well being and what we want to do. With those people, you are wasting your time. There are so many other people out there that you don't have to keep holding on to those people who aren't doing any good to  your well being. Even worse, if they are making a negative impact on you.</p>
							<p>Start by being aware of the people you are surrounding yourself with. What are their goals, their ambitions, their passions? If you don't  know then  now is the time to find out. If they don't align with the person you are trying to be, figure out whether or not they are the type of person you want to be around.</p>
							<p>“You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” ― Jim Rohn</p>
							<p>The people around you directly affect your personality and your lifestyle. The more you spend time with them, the more you develop  to be like them whether you know it or not.</p>

						<h5><font size="5" face="Rockwell">Wasted Time? Your fault.</font></h5>
							<p><font face="Georgia">"I don't have enough time."</p>
							<p>This is the worst one. You always have enough time. You THINK you don't have enough time. Work on your time management skills. All those little activities on your calendar that you haven't done in the past three weeks? Take them off your calendar.</p>
							<p>I hear this all around me but the people around me are the ones who take on much more than they should. I should know. I have had 5+ jobs in the past few years while going to school and being involved in 3+ clubs. You have the right to say no.</p>
							<p>“I’m sorry, but if your brother doesn’t want you to play with his shit, then you can’t play with it. It’s his shit. If he wants to be an asshole and not share, then that’s his right. You always have the right to be an asshole—you just shouldn’t use that right very often.” ― Justin Halpern, Sh*t My Dad Says</p>
							<p>Actually I take that back. Why should you have any control over your life and what you do? Someone asks you to do something you don't actually want to do? Every single time you say 'yes' to something you don't want to do, you waste the time and energy you could have used on something YOU wanted to do.</p>
							<p>"I have to get this done before I can start something I really want to do."</p>
							<p>You know who the real people who is wasting your time? It's you. You do it without even realizing it and it's turning into a bigger and bigger black hole that you won't be able to get out of. Take out all of this silly activities, roles, and work that has no real meaning and find something that motivates you to move forward and find out what you really want.</p></font>

							So, I've been thnking about this whole being happy thing, and I feel like people get lost when they think of happiness as a destination... We're always thinking that someday we'll be happy; we'll get that car or that job or that person in our lives that'll fix everything. But happiness is a mood, and it's a condition, not a destination. It's like  being tired or hungry, it's not permanent. It comes and goes, and that's okay. And I feel like if people thought of it that way, they'd find happiness more often. - One Tree Hill</font></p>

									I want to live simply. I want to sit by the window when it rains and read books I'll never be tested on. I want to paint because I want to, not because I've got something to prove. I want to listen to my body, fall alseep when the moon is high and wake up slowly, with no place to rush off to. I want to not be governed by money or clocks or any of the artificial restraints that humanity imposes on itself. I just want to be boundless and infinite.</font></p>
