										<h3>Shit I Say</h3>

											<p>Did you just call me fat?</p>
											<p>I use to have a Twitter but then I got distracted by the birds outside.</p>
											<p>Sometimes I answer questions with questions.</p>
											<p>Sometimes I don't even answer the questions.</p>
											<p>Sometimes I just look  at you because I'm bored and it entertains me while you try to figure out why I'm looking at you.</p>
											<p>I like how people try to figure me out but then never realize that they probably can't.</p>
											<p>I share enough. Or really nothing at all.</p>
											<p>Stop thinking, start doing</p>
											<p>I'm not here to motivate you or even care about you. I'm here to put all the things you have in the important category and move them to the silly catergorty. Because they are silly.</p>
											<p>Don't overthink. Just let things happen. I use to not be able to stop thinking. Multiple thoughts would run through my head and never stop. Swimming, driving, singing, and traveling took me away from that. Now I like not being to think (find what you can focus on). Well, time to start talking to myself again. </p>
											<p>People quit people before they quit companies <!--this can go in values--></p>
											<p>I started a blog but quickly got bored when I realized I wasn't actually doing it for myself.</p>

									<h2>Sometimes i just like to do silly shit.</h2>
											<p>I run around doing random things. I'm always looking for a job. I'm not quite sure why because it's not like I need one. I've been working multiple jobs for the last 4 or 5 years but the aspect of looking and finding something is intriguting.</p>
<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
										<p> I figured out that I am at a good point where everything I do is satifiying but I can do more for everything I am involved in. I just need to use the focus for specific aspects of my life.I have said this multiple times but I hate people. Not in a hateful or spiteful way but I have no need to be anymore people. They haven't seemed to be benficial in what it is I want to do or how I want to do it. But I am also horrible at maintaining relationships. Could be the fault of the constant movement of mmy life and never being able to stay in one place. <p>
								</div>
								<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
										<p>I've been wanting to figure out what i want to do bubt at what point do you ctually know what you want to do? There are so many rerstrictions on society where oyu are forced to conform to fit the social needs. And yet people continue to tell you to be yourself and be the best at it but where are you really going with that? It's important to have that self comnfident but then there's the line of it being too much. How do you teach where that line is and help people understand those guidelines without really following those guidelines?</p>
								</div>

								<h3>Things Other People Say</h3>
										<p>When the going gets tough, that's when other people just start saying shit.</p>
											<ul>
												<li>You can't just drive to Canada by yourself.</li> Too late. Already did.
												<li>You're crazy.</li> Crazy funny?
												<li>Angela's sketchy af</li> I do like drawing.
												<li>She's so shadey</li> Never was a big fan of the light.
												<li>You don't share enough</li> You talk too much.
												<li>You did that by yourself?</li> How else am I suppose to do it?
											</ul>
												<p>I guess 'normal' was just too complicated for me. <!--How else would a Movement and Sports Science major land at a law firm?--><br/>I think I'll just continue on this paramount movement of sketchiness, craziness, and make an adventure out of it. </p>

												<p>If you have or have heard of any other comments let me know and I will be sure to add them on!</p>


<p>The best places to swim are the ones that have no clear path to get them.

									<h3>Pioneer ASB</h3>
									<!--<p>This is pretty muched fueled my desire for leadership. They selected me to particiapte in the camp doing activities in the middle of nowhere and rooming with my classmates who I didn't even know before. Then I did leadership in middle school where some of the swimmers were involved in and did the mentoring program. Wimberg was a fantastic teacher and Point Reyes was an amazing experience. I still was not very open then. Not quite sure why. Edsall was also my Alegra teacher which was an okay class. I just remember having a class with a sub and everyone kept talknign and I told them to shut up and got in trouble even though everyoene was quiet by then. STill not sure what Rachel's Challenge is. Then there was basketball at Pioneer where I scared everyone with how loud I caan yell at people. I'm also not quite sure where that voice came from. </p>-->

									<h3>Woodland Swim Team</h3>
									<!--<p>After 10 years of swimming, I can honeslty say I hate it. Not the angry hatred everyone thinks towards the roommates or the sport due to some unhappy childhood but I hate it because I know I could of done it. I could have swwam  for the rest of my life but my internal  thoughts let the external actions of other sgert  the best of me and take away any motiviation or appreciation I had for the sport and then I  jsut continued it even though i Didn't want to. Then i did it to get away and it was a great resource for that. My  life revolved around swiiming and not  in a good way. It was everythingn I didn't want to do and i think that's where I realized I needed to  get out but for some reason i couldn't. because its the only thing I knew how to do and was able to do whithout completely failing so  I just kept continuing even though I didn't caare any more. And I pushed people away becasue of it. I just couldnt stand to care anymore becasue it didnt matter. I just wanted to get out of there and away from them  to avoid anything that could have been what I wanted. This is what started Mt. Aso.  The friendships that have stayed throughout the distanc. the ones I remember but they keep  changing into someone I dont even know anymore and someone who I'm not quite sure wants to go anywhere or do anything. nd I'm not quite sure I can be around those people anymore. I think the want to leave and get out lead to  mmy independecen and wanting to be free from restrictions. I don't work  well with restrictions. I work w ell  wiith doing my own things at my own pace. Some how people  have noticed that i dont want to be managed and dont need to be o they let me do whatever it is that I please and i take advantage of that which may or may not be a good thing but sincei I'm  doing so much and i dont know where i want to go  with it  i get distracted by ll the things thatt are going  on and overlapping with each other. and since everything i am  doing is so sdifferent, it's hard to  manitain that focus. </p>-->

									<h3>Gutwein Law</h3>
									<!--<p>I took this job hoping it would be easy. I  was super to excited to  work  at a law firm because what kind of movemen and sports science major gets this oppurtunity.  and the staffing agency that I work  for im  probably smarter than them actually i could probably guartantee that. I started off kind of rockyy trying to figure out what I wanted to do and I thinnk  the aspect of school being  a  roadblock  just let me take last smeester on like  it was just burning through my mind. I wasnt reallythinking or what i was doing and just doing it. to  the point where nothing meant anything to me. i didnt know what i wanted to  do where i wantedto end  up  or how i wanted to  get there. i just tknew i wanted to finish school and get it over with. and then there was na=other job where i knew they needed me but i just didnt even care anymore and couldnt stand oup to myself to  say no,  which would  have been best for everythhing  in that situation. i really neded the time tot figure out my poriotires and how to manage my tie before stepping formrd. this firm  has given me many oppurtunities to improve profesisonaly and in a relaxed and comfortable environemtn. they undnerstand me to some degree and like having me  there and fdont want to fire me  so thats always good. i  think those i n  person  interactions really help  with my aspect but finding out what to do  and when to  do  it is the most difficult. i really want to help in all  aspects of what theya re doing but i have no prior kowledge in any of it. htey ask me to do stuff an i strugle to know what ot do wh==for it becaue i am afraid of mesin gup and hurting their e=image. whic probabaly has been done multipke th=iems. i hate feeling  likek  i cant do something but i want to do something and everything to help them deveklop. but to do that i need to make suer i am  develoing my self to  what i want to do and then apply to th ehelping them. </p>-->

										<!--<h3>Indiana  - Friday moving to Saturday</h3>
										<p>Friday night I was going to get coffee/drinks with a friend after work. I asked for his address after work and he ended up having to finish up a project. Eh. Not a big deal. Gives me the chance to not have to spend time with people.<p>
										<p>Saturday came and I finished up at work and then headed home. He texted me later in the afternoon inviting me over to hang out with a couple of his roommates and his friends. I don't know a lot of his friends outside of our organization and the fact that would be people there would be another thing keeping me away. I decided to take a nap and head over.</p>
										<p>Walking over, I ended up seeing three people I worked with and meeting the rest of their friends or roommates. All great people and ended up being a good time. Then left after a few hours since it was past my bedtime. Cause I'm getting too old for this.</p>-->
